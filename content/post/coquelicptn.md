## Coquelic's Skills

### Thorned Blade (Basic Attack)

Coquelic attacks with her sword, dealing True Damage with each slash. Her basic attack is a Cross 1 Icon move, making her a versatile combatant.

### Poppy (Ultimate)

Coquelic grants all allied units within a single square [Scarlet Flower], which lasts for the entire battle. When this Ultimate is used again, allied units already carrying [Scarlet Flower] will recover HP equal to her Attack. [Scarlet Flower] recipients recover HP every time Coquelic deals Normal Attack Damage to an enemy, further solidifying her role as a support character.

### Floral Sword Slash (Passive)

Every 15 seconds, Coquelic's next Normal Attack becomes a Multi-Slash Attack. This effect can be stacked up to 3 times, consuming 1 stack each time it is used. [Floral Sword Slash] starts with 5 slashes, and for each allied unit carrying [Floral Sword Slash] on the field, Coquelic will deal an additional slash, up to 10 slashes. Each slash deals True Damage, which counts as Normal Attack Damage and will not cause Critical Hits.

### Timeless Memory (Passive)

Coquelic gains an Attack boost of 6%. She also accumulates Energy for each slash of [Floral Sword Slash], making her an efficient attacker and support character.

### River of Flowers (Exclusive Crimebrand Skill)

Coquelic enters a sword-wielding state during this unique skill. When an allied unit with [Scarlet Flower] deals Normal Attack Damage to an enemy, Coquelic has a chance to deal a [Floral Sword Slash] to that enemy. The duration of this state increases with skill level, making it an invaluable addition to her arsenal.

- Lv. 2: There is a 90% chance of triggering a slash, lasting for 8 seconds.
- Lv. 3: There is a 100% chance of triggering a slash, lasting for 10 seconds.
