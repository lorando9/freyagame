## Summer's Skills: A Lethal Arsenal

Summer possesses an array of skills that can turn the tide of any battle. Let's explore her skills and how they can be optimized.

### Range

**Laser Emitter:** Basic Attack

Summer deploys auto-turrets, each dealing 50% of her attack damage as Physical Damage. These auto-turrets can quickly turn the tide of battle in your favor.

### Fantastic Creation

**Ultimate Skill - 30 Energy Consumption**

Summer summons a powerful "Drone" and enhances her Attack Speed and that of all her "Drones" by 15% for 13 seconds. However, during this period, her Energy recovery is temporarily halted. This skill can be a game-changer when used strategically.

### Creation Order

Summer gains a 10% increase in damage dealt by the "Drones" she summons. This upgrade can make her "Drones" even more devastating in combat.

### Battle Statistics Plugin

For each "Drone" under her command, Summer receives a 4% Crit Rate bonus, enhancing her critical hit potential. 

### Special Ability Description

Summer's unique ability, "Summer Exclusive Brand," grants her the power of Overload. When activated, all Floating Cannons enter the Overload state, providing Summer with a 100% crit rate bonus for a limited time. However, after this state ends, the Floating Cannons become immobilized for 10 seconds. Use this ability strategically, as it can only be used once per battle.

## Characteristic: The Sinister Sinner

Summer is renowned for her prowess in Physical Damage Output. During combat, she automatically summons "Drones" that prioritize enemies attacking her. Each "Drone" deals 20% of Summer's Attack as Physical Damage. Keep in mind that a maximum of 4 "Drones" can exist on the battlefield simultaneously, and they remain active until the battle concludes.

## Leader Skill: Quick Deployment

At the start of any battle, Summer has the unique ability to instantly summon 1 "Drone." This skill ensures that she is always prepared for combat.

### Stacking Matrices

### Emotional Resonance

Reduce the Ultimate Energy Consumption by 5 points, enabling Summer to use her ultimate skill more frequently.
