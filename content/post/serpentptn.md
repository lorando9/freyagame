## Skills that Bite

Serpent's skills are nothing short of mesmerizing:

### Blade of Fang

**Basic Attack**

Serpent wields flying scythes, inflicting Magic Damage equivalent to 80% of her Attack with each strike.

### Serpent Constriction

**Ultimate Skill | 27 Energy Consumption | 1 Core Damage**

Serpent, after charging, slams the ground with chains, dealing a devastating 600% of her Attack as Magic Damage and 1 Core Damage to all nearby enemies. This leaves "Fang" marks on her adversaries for 12 seconds.

### Thermal Effect

When Serpent's grid is devoid of enemies, her Normal Attack range expands to the 3x3 square surrounding her, accompanied by a 30% Normal Attack bonus.

### Ophidian Domination

After triggering "Thermal Effect" six times, Serpent gracefully glides through the air, delivering a sweeping blow that inflicts 300% of her Attack as Magic Damage to all foes in her vicinity. This skill's speed is influenced by her Attack Speed bonus.

## Special Ability: Serpent Exclusive Brand

Serpent possesses an exclusive ability called "Serpent Exclusive Brand." When activated, she moves to a designated grid and conjures the "Star Dome Theater" within its range for 20 seconds. Within this mystical theater, the movement speed of her foes decreases by 40%, and they gain a Snake Fang mark every 2 seconds. Nacha, in particular, benefits greatly from this, enjoying a 10/12.5/15% attack boost while within the Star Dome Theater. However, please note that the Shining Stage ability can only be used once per battle.

## Characteristic: The Magic Maestro

Serpent is a Sinner who excels in Magic Damage, with her Ultimate skill delivering Core Damage. Her Normal Attack prioritizes enemies bearing "Fang" marks, dealing an additional 40% of her Attack as Magic Damage.

## Leader Skill: Bite Attack

With this leader skill, aptly named "Bite Attack," any enemy already marked with a "Fang" will suffer a punishing 200% of Serpent's Attack as Magic Damage when they receive another "Fang" mark. It's a deadly synergy that can turn the tide of battle.

## Shackles and Affinity

Serpent's journey in "Path to Nowhere" is further enhanced by her shackles and affinity:

### Shackles

1. **The Show Begins**: After using "Serpent Constriction" or "Brilliant Appearance," Serpent gains a 20% Attack Speed bonus for 12 seconds.
2. **Shackles Sync I**: Increases attack speed by 5%.
3. **Joy Comes First**: After casting "Ophidian Domination," there's a 30% chance it will be retriggered.
4. **The Sufferer**: Reduces the Energy Consumption of "Serpent Constriction" by 3 points.
5. **Shackles Sync II**: Further increases attack speed by 5%.

### Affinity

Serpent's affinity enhancements include attack bonuses and special conversations, providing players with additional depth to her character.

## Crimebrand Recommendation

### Early Game

#### Fury

After deploying her Ultimate, Serpent swiftly regenerates 20% of her HP. This ability can be triggered once every 8 seconds.

### Late Game

#### Embrace of the Dead

Serpent's late-game prowess shines through "Embrace of the Dead," which boosts damage against enemies in a Breaking state by a formidable 40%.

With Serpent's intricate skillset, ascension upgrades, and powerful leader skills, she's an asset you won't want to miss in your journey through the mysterious world of "Path to Nowhere." Whether you're in the early stages of the game or the late-game battles, Serpent's magical prowess and bite are bound to leave a lasting mark on your adventure.
