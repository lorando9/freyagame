- Stage 5: Shackles Sync II - Energy Recovery speed +7.5%

## Skills

Cabernet possesses several unique skills:

### Savoring
- Basic Attack: Cabernet attacks using soul energy, dealing (Attack *84%) Magic Damage each time.

### Thirst and Hunger
- Ultimate: Cabernet releases the power of souls, dispelling all debuffs from all allies within the skill range and healing them for 20% of her Max HP. Simultaneously, Cabernet consumes all [Soul Fragments], increasing the attack of all allies in the skill range by 5% for 12 seconds.

### Seize
- Passive: Every time Cabernet gains a [Soul Fragment], she gains a 20% increase in Max HP, stackable up to 3 times.

### Ingest
- Passive: Each time Cabernet uses [Thirst and Hunger], she gains a 4% increase in Energy Recovery Speed for 10 seconds.

### Throne of Gluttony
- Exclusive Crimebrand Skill: Cabernet deals 1 Core Damage to all enemies within a single grid, obtaining 2 [Soul Fragments]. She then locks onto an enemy with the highest Max HP and generates a [Soul Essence] in a grid that the enemy can walk on within a 3x3 square around her. If no such grids are available, [Soul Essence] cannot be generated. [Soul Essence] inherits 600% of Cabernet's base Max HP and an equal amount of the enemy's Defense and Magic Resistance, lasting 10 seconds. When [Soul Essence] loses HP, the enemy loses an equal amount of HP. When [Soul Essence] dies, it deals additional (Cabernet's Max HP *200%) Magic Damage to the enemy. "Throne of Gluttony" has a 12-second cooldown and can only be used twice in each battle.

## Cabernet Crimebrands Recommendation

Here are some recommendations for Cabernet's Crimebrands:

- Tuning zero + Hope + Corridor or justice + corridor
- Various options are available depending on your playstyle and needs.

For different game modes like BFL and ToA, you can consider the following sets:

**BFL**
- Standard Energy 3 set
- Nightmare/Corridor (if Energy is not an issue)

**ToA**
- Justice
- Paradise for extra core break
- Soul Rift for Physical teams in need of shred
- Reunion in crit teams for energy regeneration and better uptime

Don't forget to consider Nightmare of Revelations + Hope as it complements Cabernet's abilities, making her a valuable addition to your team. This recommendation is especially useful if you need to replace another character in your lineup, as her fear ability doesn't affect all enemies.
