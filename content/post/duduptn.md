## Skills that Harmonize with the Phoenix

### Musical Performance - Basic Attack

Dudu doesn't perform normal attacks. Instead, she gives a Musical Performance, restoring (Attack * 26%) HP per second to an allied unit marked with "Phoenix's Call" within the performance range.

### Song of Phoenix - Ultimate Skill

Dudu marks one allied unit within her performance range with "Phoenix's Call," which lasts for the entire battle. When using the Ultimate again on an allied unit already marked with "Phoenix's Call," it restores (Attack * 350%) HP for that unit. If the unit leaves the performance range or another allied unit gains the "Phoenix's Call," the previous "Phoenix's Call" effect will disappear.

### Come Home to Roost

The allied unit marked with "Phoenix's Call" gains a 5% Max HP bonus, restoring 1% of Max HP per second.

### Triumphant Silence

When "Phoenix's Call" ends, the allied unit's damage dealt increases by 13.3% for 8 seconds.

## Special Ability - Hundred Birds Facing the Phoenix

[DuduÂ·Exclusive Brandin] introduces a new exclusive skill, "Hundred Birds Facing the Phoenix." Dudu taps into the power of the phoenix within a specified single cell range, increasing the damage of friendly units within the range by 3% / 3.5% / 4% every 4 seconds. This effect can stack up to 5 times and lasts for 4 seconds. Note that "Hundred Birds Facing the Phoenix" can only be used once in each battle.

## Characteristic - The Supportive Sinner

Dudu is a sinner, but she excels at supporting her allies. She enters battles with her Ultimate Energy fully charged, ready to turn the tide of battle in her favor.
